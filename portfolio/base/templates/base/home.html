                            <p>Back in the early 2000s, I decided to try my hand at creating custom MySpace themes
                            and fell head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to
                            today, and I've had the privilege of building software for a livestreaming startup, a global
                            engineering solutions provider, and an information technology consultation firm.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I'm currently open for new roles and experiences, please don't hesitate to reach out if
                            you would like to collaborate and work on your project!</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually hiking with my dog Loki, rooting for soccer
                            teams, or trying to find video games that keep me engaged.</p>

                            <h6 class="header">Software Developer at Novus Labs</h6>
                            <p>Developed a livestreaming platform used to broadcast real time video of marathons and
                            other races in remote outdoor locations. This platform included a custom web application
                            powered by Django/Python where users could log in and watch races live. Additionally, I
                            developed a custom network bonding software/hardware platform which allowed for broadcasting
                            live video in low connectivity outdoor locations.</p>
                            <p>In addition, I created various Python and Java based software solutions for a variety of
                            use-cases related to computer vision and hardware testing. Technologies utilized included
                            OpenCV, BoofCV, AWS, BitBucket, and JavaScript.</p>

                            <p>Worked directly in an Agile/Scrum development environment on a variety of projects
                            including a content management system for a local production theater company. Utilized
                            ASP.NET & C# that provided an excellent learning experience in understanding MVC &
                            Entity Framework on deeper level. Created a Django based web application that allowed for
                            the tracking and cataloging of inventory. This provided a great opportunity to learn
                            Django's MVT structure with a direct relation to a SQL database.

                                <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart and examine
                                piece by piece. I break code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do.
                                Documentation is key, but ultimately is just a reference.</p>

                                something new! I'm looking to expand my development skills into new areas and work with
                                teams to produce innovative new solutions and products. I would love a position where I
                                can be part of a bigger team and learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
